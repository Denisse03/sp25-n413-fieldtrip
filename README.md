## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

For my web project I chose the topic to focus on the Native American Artwork. The reason why I chose this topic is because I enjoyed the artwork that they had displaced. For example the outfits, jewelry, and painting they had.

### Core Webpages

- I would have an Home Page which introduces the Museum and have a special annoucment with an animation coming into the left to right highlighting the Native American Artwork.
- I would have an About Page which will talk about the history of Native American and have animation of images and text zoomming in when the page is being scrolled down.
- I would have an Artwork Page with subheading underneath it with it being outfits, jewelry, and painting. The Artwork Page will talk about the most popular artwork they have. There will also be a filtering button to filter through the artwork. In the outfit page it will be about the outfits they have the same goes with the jewelry and painting.
- I would have an Error Page which if there is a broken link or page than the user can hit a button to go back to the home page.

### Design Choices

The websites that I will references are the following

- https://collections.eiteljorg.org/collections/15844/native-american-art-highlights/objects

The colors I will be using are the following

- White: Use as the background of the page making it easier for people to read the text and see the images well.
- Brown: Use for the heading of the title of the artwork
- Black: For the text explaning the artwork.
- Orange: For the button to go back home

For the tags and categories I would say it will be the following

- Outfits
- Jewelry
- Painting
- Native American
- Artwork
- Bandolier bag
- Face to Face
- Garter
- Moccasin

This will make it easier for people to find specific artworks.
